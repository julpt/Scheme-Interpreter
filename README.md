# Scheme-Interpreter  
 UCB CS61A Project 4: Scheme Interpreter  
 My solution to this project, using starter code provided at [cs61a.org](https://cs61a.org/proj/scheme/).  
 Contributions in **scheme_classes.py**, **scheme_eval_apply.py**, and **scheme_forms.py**.  
   
 The rest of the files in the project:
 - scheme.py: the interpreter REPL
 - pair.py: defines the Pair class and the nil object
 - scheme_builtins.py: built-in Scheme procedures
 - scheme_reader.py: the reader for Scheme input (this file is obfuscated so that you can implement it in lab)
 - scheme_tokens.py: the tokenizer for Scheme input
 - scheme_utils.py: functions for inspecting Scheme expressions
 - ucb.py: utility functions for use in 61A projects
 - tests.scm: a collection of test cases written in Scheme
 - ok: the autograder
 - tests: a directory of tests used by ok
 - mytests.rst: a file for own tests
